![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. It also uses date-fns to formate timestamps. This application only features back-end functionality, so the API routes must be tested in an environment such as Insomnia.
